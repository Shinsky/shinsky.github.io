I've never been a big fan of writing... despite the fact that’s most of what I do day to day at work. But I've been yearning for a place to put my thoughts, catalogue interests, and share a bit about myself. 

*This is that place.*

Nostalgia is definitely a big part of this. Think back to the era when people had websites and personal blogs. I'm not saying that was a better time, or this is a worse time (it might be) — only that I just want to experience it all again.

So here we go!
