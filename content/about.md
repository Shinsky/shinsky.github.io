            <h2>hey, I'm andrew.</h2>
            <p>I've spent my whole life making videos, wasting time online, and messing around with technology. This is a place where I can do those things… without judgment. It's all really just for me. But if you're here, thanks.</p>

                <h4>iPhone 17 Pro</h4>
                <p>Cosmic Orange. Can't stop looking at this thing. Was torn about the color but I love it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="carrying-item">
                <h4>Apple Watch Series 6</h4>
                <p>44MM Stainless Steel. Motivates me to actually keep running and moving.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="carrying-item">
                <h4>AirPods Pro 3</h4>
                <p>Never liked the fit of the Pros until this generation! Stay in my ear 99% of the time and the mixed foam/rubber tips are a game changer for the noise control features.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="carrying-item">
                <h4>Peak Design Mobile Wallet</h4>
                <p>Charcoal. Slim, sleek, and snaps to my phone. I've never been a big wallet guy and this fits the bill (but really, it doesn't!)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="carrying-item">
                <h4>XTEINK X4</h4>
                <p>Frost White. E-ink reading on the go.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="carrying-item">
                <h4>iPod mini</h4>
                <p>Blue. Because sometimes you just want music, nothing else.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="carrying-item">
                <h4>EarPods</h4>
                <p>3.5mm. No batteries, no pairing, just plug in and go.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="carrying-item">
                <h4>TrimUI Brick Hammer</h4>
                <p>Silver. Throw MinUI on it and this thing is great for GBA faves including Tetris Worlds, Advance Wars 2, and The Sims Bustin' Out.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="carrying-item">
                <h4>Samsung Maxima Elite 140</h4>
                <p>35mm point and shoot and shoot fun!</p>
