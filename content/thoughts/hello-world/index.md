Welcome to the thoughts section. This is where I'll be writing about tech, nostalgia, and whatever else is on my mind.

I've wanted a place to write for a while now — not on someone else's platform, not optimized for engagement, just a quiet corner of the internet where I can put things down. This is that place.

Expect posts about the stuff I carry, the tech I'm into, retro computing, and the occasional longer piece when something's been stuck in my head long enough. No schedule, no pressure.

Thanks for reading.
