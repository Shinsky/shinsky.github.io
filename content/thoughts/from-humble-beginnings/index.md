I've never been a big fan of writing... despite that being most of my day to day at work. But I've been yearning for a place to put thoughts, catalogue my interests, and share a bit about myself. 

*This is that place.*

Nostalgia is a big part of this. Thinking back to an era where people had websites and blogs. I'm not trying to say that was a better time, that this is a worse time (it might be), only that I just want to experience that again.

So here we go!
