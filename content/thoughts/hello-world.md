Welcome to the thoughts section. This is where I'll be writing about tech, nostalgia, and whatever else is on my mind.
Expect posts about the stuff I carry, the tech I'm into, retro computing, and the occasional longer piece when something's been stuck in my head long enough. No schedule, no pressure.

Thanks for reading.
